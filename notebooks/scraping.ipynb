    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Car.gr is one of the largest platforms in Greece for buying and selling cars, scooters, boats, and other vehicles, though it is primarily used for car sales. Sellers list their vehicles, and buyers can contact them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the market value of a used car is challenging due to numerous influencing factors, including mileage, model, brand, year, condition, options, gearbox type, and accident history. Additionally, hidden factors such as location, supply and demand, and even color might impact prices. Given these complexities, gaining insights from data could help better understand pricing dynamics.\n",
    "Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore these challenges, I aim to scrape, preprocess, and analyze car listings from Car.gr to build useful tools, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    üìä Market Analysis: Statistical insights into pricing trends and factors influencing car values.\n",
    "    üí∞ Price Estimation Model: Predict car prices based on listing attributes.\n",
    "    ü§ñ Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enable users to query listings using natural language.\n",
    "    üîç Fraud Detection & Anomaly Detection: Identify fraudulent listings using text and image classification.\n",
    "    üñº Image-Based Vehicle Condition Assessment: Use computer vision to assess car conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Motivation & Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "After a two-year break from data science, this project serves as a hands-on opportunity to refresh and update my skills. The main technical focus areas include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Web Scraping & Data Storage ‚Äì Reinforcing skills in Python, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and databases.\n",
    "    Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Analysis ‚Äì Extracting meaningful insights from raw data.\n",
    "    Machine Learning for Price Prediction ‚Äì Building and evaluating pricing models.\n",
    "    Implementing a RAG-based Chatbot ‚Äì Exploring state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation techniques.\n",
    "    Image Classification for Car Condition Assessment ‚Äì Applying deep learning for visual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most crucial step is scraping the website, as it forms the foundation for all subsequent tasks. This will be my immediate focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code will be found on my github repos"

    "\n",
    "We can see that the ads are organised as follows:\n",

    "- A title: Usually brand and model of the car\n",
    "- A short description\n",
    "- A price\n",
    "- Information about the seller\n",

    "- Engine Power\n",
    "- Number of doors\n",
    "- Gearbox type\n",
